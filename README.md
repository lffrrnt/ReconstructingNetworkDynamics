# ReconstructingNetworkDynamics
The reconstruction scheme used in the paper ["Reconstructing Network Dynamics of Coupled Discrete Chaotic Units from Data"](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.117401).

Our approach reveals the network dynamics from data in a neuroscientific setting by blending dynamical systems theories and statistical learning tools.

In this repository, you will find the codes to regenerate the synthetical data and the functions to solve the inverse problem of finding the governing eqaution of the networked dynamical system from time series observations.
